# DataDAO Governance Process

*This draft will be updated as we get closer to the launch of the DataDAO. If you have suggestions, message us on [Discord](https://discord.gg/6SCaPXsA5M).*

## Scope

The DataDAO governance process has authority over:

- The DataDAO multisig, including multisig membership and DataDAO's Juicebox project.
- DataDAO's formal processes, including this governance process and the multisig process.

Within the bounds of the law. DataDAO's governance process does not have authority over:

- Communication channels, including Discord, Twitter, and the DataDAO website.
- DataDAO's legal entity.

## Governance Schedule

DataDAO's governance process follows a 14-day cycle:

1. Day 1 (Saturday): **Project updated & temperature check begins.** Any updates to DataDAO's project from the previous cycle take effect, and temperature checks for this cycle's proposals begin. 
2. Day 4 (Tuesday): **Snapshot vote.** Formal proposal voting is conducted on Snapshot.
3. Day 8 (Saturday): **Multisig execution.** The DataDAO multisig executes approved proposals.
4. Day 12 (Wednesday):  **3-day delay.** DataDAO's project is locked for 3 days before the next cycle begins. This is enforced on-chain.

All "days" start at 00:00 UTC. The next cycle begins exactly 14 days after the previous cycle began.

## Step 0 - Discussion

Discussion proposals can be made in DataDAO's GitHub issues at any time. When ready, authors can change a proposal's status from `Draft` to `Discussion` to start a discussion thread in [DataDAO's Discord](https://discord.gg/6SCaPXsA5M).

## Step 1 - Temperature Check

`Begins on Day 1 (Saturday 00:00 UTC)`

A 3-day üëç/üëé Discord poll (a "temperature check") is made for each proposal submitted by the start of a Governance Cycle. While this poll is active, authors can update or redact their proposals as they get feedback. Verified Discord members with at least 1 $DATA get one vote for each poll.

Proposals with 10 or more "üëç" votes and at least 30% "üëç" votes move to Snapshot voting.

## Step 2 - Snapshot Voting

`Begins on Day 4 (Tuesday 00:00 UTC)`

A 4-day¬†For/Against/Abstain Snapshot vote is made for proposals approved by temperature checks. $DATA holders get one vote per $DATA held for each proposal, and can delegate their voting power on Snapshot.

Proposals with 20,000 or more "For" votes and at least 66% "For" votes (not counting "Abstain" votes) will be implemented.

## Step 3 - Execution

`Begins on Day 7 (Saturday 00:00 UTC)`

The DataDAO multisig executes approved proposals according to their specifications.

- If approved proposals conflict with each other, more recently approved proposals take priority for the conflicting part. If they were approved at the same time, the proposal with more "For" votes takes priority.
- Proposals are effective when they are approved on Snapshot, unless they say otherwise.
- Parts of proposals which are illegal or impossible to execute won't be executed.
- The multisig can modify a proposal's specification within reason to simplify on-chain logistics.

The multisig controls DataDAO's Juicebox project. DataDAO governance execution depends upon the cooperation of the multisig's elected signers, who have committed to executing the will of the DAO as expressed by the Governance Process.

#### Step 4 - 3-day Delay

`Begins on Day 12 (Wednesday 00:00 UTC)`

Any changes to DataDAO's project must be submitted at least 3 days before the next cycle starts. This is enforced on-chain. This gives DAO members time to verify queued changes, and to burn their $DATA if desired.
